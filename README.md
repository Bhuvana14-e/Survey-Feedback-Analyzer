# Survey-Feedback-Analyzer
This project aims to help you apply core Python programming concepts to build a text-based feedback analysis tool. You will work with survey feedback entries stored in a dictionary of lists, perform basic data cleaning, extract meaningful insights, and apply logic using loops, conditionals, string operations, and user-defined functions.
